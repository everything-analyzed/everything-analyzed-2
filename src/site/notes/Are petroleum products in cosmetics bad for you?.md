<h1 style="color: #8095a4; font-size: 20px">The misconception about petroleum products in cosmetics</h1>
<p style= font-color: #929292>For a long time, I avoided any skincare products that listed **[[Petroleum Products/What are the 5 most common petroleum products found in cosmetics?\|common petroleum-derived ingredients]]** at the top of their labels. I thought things like mineral oil and petrolatum were toxic, at worst, or would clog my pores, at best. I figured that people who used petroleum jelly (like Vaseline), just didn't know any better and were missing out on the "cleaner," natural alternatives.</p>

## **Understanding the petroleum refining process**

My perspective changed when I looked into the actual processing of **[[Petroleum Products/crude oil\|crude oil]]**. Petroleum products meant for use In the cosmetic and pharmaceutical worlds are produced via a **[[rigorous refining process\|rigorous refining process]]** to remove impurities—specifically **[[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]]**, which are the actual cause for concern in unrefined oil.

## **The laws of petroleum purity**

The standard of what's "safe" isn't left for the companies refining the oil to decide. it is strictly regulated by legal **[[purity standards\|purity standards]]** (such as the USP grade in the United States). **[[MoM/Law & Crime/Legal issues in the petroleum industry\|Refineries can face severe civil and criminal consequences]]** if they fail to meet these standards for products intended for human use. The law essentially acts as a safety barrier between industrial manufacturing and consumer health.

## **Petroleum products could be a better choice** (for your skin)

Contrary to what I thought was true for such a long time, **[[petroleum-derived ingredients can be a better choice\|petroleum-derived ingredients can be a better choice]]** under some circumstances. Unlike many plant-based oils, highly refined petroleum is **[[biologically inert\|biologically inert]]**. It doesn't oxidize or react with the skin’s chemistry. Instead, it acts as a highly effective **[[biological barrier\|biological barrier]]**.

For all it good qualities, though, we know there's some exploration to be done into the **[[impact of the petroleum industry on the environment\|impact of the petroleum industry on the environment]]**.


### **Research Debt / Next Steps**

- **The "[[Clean Beauty\|Clean Beauty]]" Narrative:** 
	- Why is there such a strong social push against petroleum if the legal and scientific standards are so high? (Link to: [[MoM/Collective Fictions/Collective Fictions\|Collective Fictions]])
- **Stability vs. Bioactivity:** 
	- How does the "inert" nature of mineral oil compare to the "active" nature of botanical oils?
