 <h3 style="color: #8095a4; font-size: 18px">What is a Scanner?</h3

Most people are taught to pick one lane and stay there. A "Scanner" does the opposite. I’m a researcher who prefers to move horizontally—checking under the hood of several different worlds at once.  

This is my **Digital Garden**. It’s a place where I indulge in the pleasure of "wondering". I don't just want to file information away; I want to understand the mechanics of the world we live in.

I hope you can take a moment away from what you have  to think about and discover something here that you never really thought to question
