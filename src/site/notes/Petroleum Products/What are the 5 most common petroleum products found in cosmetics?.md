### The Reality

The cosmetic industry relies on petroleum derivatives because they are chemically inert, highly stable, and cost-effective. Despite the "clean beauty" push, these substances are often safer for sensitive skin than plant-based alternatives because they do not oxidize or contain complex organic allergens. The primary issue is not toxicity, but the **refining standard**required to move a substance from a fuel-grade byproduct to a cosmetic-grade ingredient.

### The 5 Most Common Derivatives

1. **Petrolatum** (AKA: **Petroleum Jelly**)
    
    - **Mechanism:** A complex mixture of semi-solid hydrocarbons. It acts as a physical barrier (occlusive) that reduces Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) by 98%.
        
    - **Common Products:** _Vaseline, Aquaphor Healing Ointment, CeraVe Healing Ointment, Vicks BabyRub, Bag Balm._
        
2. **Mineral Oil** (AKA: **Paraffinum Liquidum**)
    
    - **Mechanism:** A distilled byproduct of petroleum. In its refined "USP Grade" form, it is a non-comedogenic emollient used as a foundational solvent.
        
    - **Common Products:** _Johnson’s Baby Oil, Bio-Oil, Ponds Cold Cream, Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream, E45 Moisturising Cream._
        
3. **Paraffin Wax** (AKA: **Crystalline Wax**)
    
    - **Mechanism:** A solid-state hydrocarbon used to provide structural integrity to sticks and balms. It creates "glide" and water resistance.
        
    - **Common Products:** _ChapStick, Burt’s Bees (often blended with beeswax), L’Oreal Colour Riche Lipsticks, Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, e.l.f. Instant Lift Brow Pencil._
        
4. **PEGs** (AKA: **Polyethylene Glycols**)
    
    - **Mechanism:** Petroleum-linked polymers used as surfactants and emulsifiers. They allow oil and water to bond and remain stable.
        
    - **Common Products:** _Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (PEG-7), Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, Dove Body Wash, Pantene Pro-V Shampoos, various hand sanitizers._
        
5. **Synthetic Fragrance** (AKA: **Parfum**)
    
    - **Mechanism:** A proprietary blend of chemicals, primarily benzene derivatives and phthalates. Legally, the specific petroleum-based constituents do not have to be disclosed.
        
    - **Common Products:** _Dior Sauvage (and most designer colognes), Bath & Body Works lotions, Gain/Tide detergents, Degree Antiperspirant, scented candles._

### The "Scanner" Perspective

We treat "Petroleum" as a singular dirty word, but the material reality is a spectrum of purity. The law draws an arbitrary but necessary line at **USP (United States Pharmacopeia) Grade**. Below that line, the substance is an industrial lubricant; above it, it is a medical-grade skin protectant. The substance hasn't changed its origin—only its level of filtration.

The irony of the "Material World" is that the most "natural" plant oils are often more chemically volatile and irritating to the human immune system than these highly processed fossil fuel derivatives. We are essentially wearing the Jurassic period to our morning meetings because it’s the most stable chemistry we've found.
