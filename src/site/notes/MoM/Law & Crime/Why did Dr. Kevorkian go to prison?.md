### Background
>[!Who was Dr. Jack Kevorkian?]
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, aka "Dr. Death", was most well known for his strong advocacy for [[assisted suicide\|assisted suicide]] for the terminally ill and his practice of participating in them.

>[!Criminal trials]
Dr. Jack Kevorkian faced five criminal trials between 1994 and 1999, with three acquittals, one mistrial and one conviction.<br>
>>[!Trial Details]-

>[!conviction]-
>In November 1998, Dr. Kevorkian made an extraordinarily bold and public challenge to his opposers when he broadcast the videotaped death of Thomas Youk on *60 Minutes*.  The video shows Kevorkian administering the lethal injection to Youk. <br>
>The key difference between the first four trials and the last was the level of Dr. Kevorkian's involvement in the patient's suicide, and the resulting criminal charge. In Youk's case, Kevorkian was not accused of not only *assisting* in a suicide; he was also accused of first-degree murder and administering a controlled substance.

This was a man who created the opportunity for suffering people and their families to exit that suffering with peace and dignity
### Exploration

> [!note] The Questions
>Based on our laws, there's not much question about why Dr. Kevorkian was convicted in 1999. Despite the context, he directly inflicted an action upon another person that caused said person to die. The more interesting question to me is not about his conviction, but about his guilt. From a philosophical or humanistic standpoint-- what was Dr. Kevorkian guilty of? When considering the answer, the fact that he was not found guilty in his first four trials may become more poignant. Did he not do exactly what he was accused of then? What was the difference in his final trial?


>[!Research]
>1. What is the history of laws around assisted suicide?
>2. What were the flaws in Dr. Kevorkian's process?
>3. How should the [[Hippocratic Oath\|Hippocratic Oath]] be interpreted?

>[!Discoveries]
>- #### The Hippocratic Oath
>	- The Oath is a symbolic commitment, but not legally required or binding.
