 > [!abstract] Why does it matter?
>  I started reading up on Dr. Kevorkian when I saw parts of his 1994 trial on TV. I've watched a lot of trials, but never one where the victim wanted to die and asked for help in doing so. 
 > 
 > I was just a little kid when Dr. Kevorkian was a public sensation, so when I was watching, I was surprised to realize "Dr. Death" wasn't who I thought. I had subconsciously blended Dr. Kevorkian and Dr. Josef Mengle. Such a ominous name must have been given someone doing terrible things, right? As it would turn out, I couldn't understand why Dr. Jack Kevorkian was even on trial. 
 > 
 > This was a man who created the opportunity for suffering people and their families to exit that suffering with peace and dignity.

> [!question] I want to examine the laws and around assisted suicide and, by extension, the ways in which society dictates what actions should be ruled by law.

I also want to examine the way that society determines what is good and bad, right and wrong.
### Who was Jack Kevorkian?
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, aka "Dr. Death", was most well known for his strong advocacy for [[assisted suicide\|assisted suicide]] for the terminally ill and his practice of participating in them.
### The trials of Jack Kevorkian
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was found guilty of second-degree murder in the 1999 death of Thomas Youk. He had faced four previous criminal trials between 1994 and 1997, with three acquittals and one mistrial.

The key difference between the first four trials and the last was the level of Dr. Kevorkian's involvement in the patient's suicide, and the resulting criminal charge. In Youk's case, Kevorkian was not accused of not only *assisting* in a suicide; he was also accused of first-degree murder and administering a controlled substance.

### Why was Dr. Kevorkian charged with murder?
In November 1998, Dr. Kevorkian made an extraordinarily bold and public challenge to his opposers when he broadcast the videotaped death of Thomas Youk on *60 Minutes*.  The video shows Kevorkian administering the lethal injection to Youk.
