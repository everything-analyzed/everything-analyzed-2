All brain injuries do not lead to brain death. Brain death only occurs when a specific mechanical "tipping point" is reached, leading to a total physiological collapse:

  

• Swelling (Edema): Following a stroke, trauma, or overdose, the brain cells begin to hold onto water. As they swell, they take up the tiny amount of "buffer space" normally reserved for [Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/csf-cerebrospinal-fluid).

• Intracranial Pressure (ICP): Once the buffer space is gone, the internal pressure skyrockets. The brain begins to compress its own blood vessels.

• The Perfusion Failure: This is the mechanical "death spiral." To get oxygen, the heart must pump blood into the skull. But if the pressure inside the skull is higher than your blood pressure, the blood is physically blocked from entering. The brain is effectively being strangled from the inside out.

• Herniation: In a final, desperate move, the high pressure forces the brain tissue downward through the only exit: the foramen magnum (the hole at the base of the skull where the spinal cord starts). As the brainstem is pushed through this narrow opening, it is crushed.

• Autolysis: Once the blood flow has been blocked for several minutes, the brain cells lose their structural integrity and begin to liquify. At this point, even if you were to "fix" the original injury, there is no longer a biological architecture left to support life.
